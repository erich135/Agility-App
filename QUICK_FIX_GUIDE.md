# 🔧 Quick Fix Guide - Database Setup

## ⚠️ Issue You're Experiencing

The error `Could not find the 'company_income_tax_number' column of 'clients'` means your database schema is missing some columns.

## ✅ Solution: Run Database Migration

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

1. Click "New Query"
2. Copy and paste the entire content of `database/fix_schema_migration.sql`
3. Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter
4. Wait for the green success message

### Step 3: Verify Tables
Run this query to verify all tables exist:
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

You should see these tables:
- ✅ clients
- ✅ directors
- ✅ documents
- ✅ activity_logs
- ✅ notifications
- ✅ notification_preferences
- ✅ tasks

## 🚨 Alternative: Run Full Enhanced Schema

If you haven't run the enhanced features schema yet:

1. Open SQL Editor in Supabase
2. Run the file: `database/enhanced_features_schema.sql`
3. This creates ALL new feature tables and adds missing columns

---

## 📝 After Running Migration

### Test These Features:
1. ✅ Edit customer (should save without errors)
2. ✅ Dashboard loads (/dashboard)
3. ✅ Notification center (bell icon) doesn't show errors
4. ✅ Customer management works smoothly

---

## 🔧 Still Having Issues?

### Check Database Connection
```sql
SELECT NOW(); -- Should return current timestamp
```

### Check User Permissions
```sql
SELECT current_user, current_database();
```

### Verify Clients Table Structure
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'clients' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always backup before migrations:**
   - Supabase > Database > Backups
   - Or export current data

2. **Run migrations during low traffic:**
   - Migrations can lock tables briefly

3. **Test in development first:**
   - If you have a dev/staging environment

4. **Check Vercel Environment Variables:**
   - Make sure VITE_SUPABASE_URL points to the right database
   - Verify VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is correct

---

## 🎯 Quick Commands

### In Supabase SQL Editor:

**1. Check if table exists:**
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_name = 'notifications'
);
```

**2. Check if column exists:**
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 'clients' 
  AND column_name = 'company_income_tax_number'
);
```

**3. Add single column manually:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE clients 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS company_income_tax_number VARCHAR(50);
```
